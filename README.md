Champion-Level Drone Racing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This pseudocode accompanies the manuscript. It consists of three parts:

1. `drift_estimator`: pseudocode for estimating VIO drift from gate detections and VIO readings.
2. `gate_detector`: pseudocode for gate detection from images recorded from the onboard camera.
3. `swift_policy`: pseudocode for policy training and residual model identification.
